# gcore_port_allowed_address_pairs (Resource)

Manages allowed address pairs for any private port attached to a Virtual Instance.

If the 'port_id' belongs to a 'gcore_reservedfixedip' resource, it is recommended to add
'ignore_changes = [allowed_address_pairs]' to the 'gcore_reservedfixedip' resource and include
'depends_on = [gcore_instancev2.<resource>]' in the current resource.

This ensures that the allowed address pairs are configured only after
the Reserved Fixed IP has been associated with the Virtual Instance.
